## 🖼️ Diagrams

Diagrams in this repository are:
- Organized by category in the `diagrams/` directory
- Referenced directly in book content using relative paths
- Version-controlled alongside the text for consistency
- Available in various formats (SVG, PNG, etc.)

### Creating Diagrams
When adding diagrams:
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `microservices-architecture.svg`)
- Place them in the appropriate category subdirectory
- Include source files when applicable (e.g., `.drawio` files)
- Optimize images for web viewing while maintaining clarity

## 📝 Writing Standards

Books in this repository follow these guidelines:
- **Clarity**: Technical accuracy with clear explanations
- **Examples**: Practical, real-world code examples
- **Structure**: Logical progression from fundamentals to advanced topics
- **References**: Proper citations and external resource links
- **Accessibility**: Content suitable for various skill levels

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

This repository may utilize:
- Markdown for content writing
- Git for version control
- Various diagramming tools (draw.io, Mermaid, PlantUML, etc.)
- Documentation generators for final output
